# NodeMCURGBWifi 

This is a small boiler plate project to get a quick start on Arduino NodeMCU platform projects that need Wifi support. The reason this project exists is because of a few LED lamps I made that I needed to react to web related events. There is built in support for Wifi, change the broadcasting SSID name to whatever you want.
